# Lessons Learned

1. The most time-consuming part of the project was to determining how to use layout for individual project pages that share similar styles. My initial approach was to pass JSON data to individual project page layout to render pages. This turned out to be cumbersome to write project descriptions in JSON file as these are long texts, and not all projects share the same data field.
2. My second approach was to include CMS Primisic.
3. MDX to write in Markup
4. Individual pages with shared styles
